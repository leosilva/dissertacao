%\noindent Applications are increasingly inserted into society through various devices. Many of them are complex due to their scale, making their architecture also complex to understand and maintain. The software visualization area uses techniques that aim to improve software understanding and make its development process more productive. The lack of activities for developers and architects to understand the architectural evolution can lead to its degradation, causing the quality criteria initially set no longer met. In this sense, in relation to measuring the performance of applications, profiling tools and APM can be used, however, fail to provide adequate metrics and visualizations to monitor the evolution of this quality attribute. This work presents a set of software visualizations to help analyze the evolution of performance between versions of a software, allowing developers and architects to identify methods of scenarios that have degraded or improved their performance. The proposed set of visualizations will be evaluated from empirical studies conducted in open source applications.

\noindent\textit{Keywords}: software architecture, software visualization, software evolution.
